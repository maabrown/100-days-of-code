# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I have cleaned up my routes.js file for my app.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes it really helps to just walk back through your code all over again to make sure that you understand all the moving parts.

### Day 2: Apr 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to clean up profile path for app and using the right syntax for $http requests using Angular.

**Thoughts**: Using tutorials are great, but sometimes you have to work the code out yourself. Also, I need a better way of deleting console.log when I don't need them and not being afraid to delete code in the worry that I will 'need' it later. It has mostly been messing me up.
